# Wiremock Android Example
A working example of wiremock working with android.

- Started with MyProjectWithWireMock.zip from https://www.dropbox.com/s/ityzj8co7k0yrgt/MyProjectWithWireMock.zip?dl=0 originally wrote by indraneel76.
- Moved project to Android Studio which added in gradle files.
- Created new tests using Espresso and jUnit4.
- Moved wiremock support to androidtest

To Do
- Better clean up libraries by using the gradle reference for wiremock. Currently this blows up when running tests.
